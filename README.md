Welcome to the Coding Ninjas HTML Project! This project showcases my proficiency in HTML by creating a multi-page website for a fictional coding education platform, Coding Ninjas. The website includes various sections that provide information about courses, user enrollment, testimonials, and contact details.

## HTML Tags and Concepts Learned

Throughout this project, I learned to effectively use the following HTML tags and concepts:

- **Basic Structure**: Understanding the structure of an HTML document with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Headings**: Utilizing `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc., to create a clear hierarchy of information.
- **Paragraphs**: Using `<p>` to structure text content.
- **Lists**: Implementing ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`) for organizing information.
- **Tables**: Creating tables with `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`, including the use of `colspan` and `rowspan`.
- **Forms**: Building forms using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<label>` for user input.
- **Links**: Adding hyperlinks with `<a>` to navigate between pages.
- **Images**: Inserting images with `<img>` and linking them to other pages.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>` to improve document structure and accessibility.
